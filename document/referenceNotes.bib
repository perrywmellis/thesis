note = {The tracking minimizes $\sum_i \delta_i$, where $\delta_i$ is the
distance between the i$^{\rm th}$ particle in one image and a candidate particle in the
subsequent image. For $N$ particles, this scales like $\mathcal{O}(N!)$; to reduce runtime,
the algorithm has a cutoff length $L$, considering possible candidates only
where $\delta_i < L$.}

note = {At each timestep, a random acceleration, or kick, is added to the equations of motion;
each kick is drawn indepently from the same probability distribution.}

note = {The viscosity of the active nematic in the tubulent regime is primarily
determined by the surrounding medium. Since we keep the same outer medium, we use
the same viscosity for both ATP concentrations.}
