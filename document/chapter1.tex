\chapter{Introduction}
Ordered materials are everywhere, materials with a preferred local arrangement.
They exist on multiple lengthscales and make up the majority of the elastic solids.
Preferred local arrangement manifests itself as macroscoscale symmetries that affect the properties of the material.
Example is the birefringence that arises in NLC.
Places where the order is not satisfied (broken symmetry) are defects.
Defects also affect material properties and are essential to understanding the physics of disorder, phase transitions, etc.
Defects can arise from kinetics like grain boundaries in polyxtalline materials.
Defects can also be required due to the frustration that arieses from confinement.
Example is packing on a sphere.
