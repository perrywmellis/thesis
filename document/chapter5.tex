\chapter{Homeotropic nematics confined in capillary bridges}

\section{Introduction}
The research presented so far has focused on nematic materials confined by toroidal surfaces.
Here we consider a NLC confined to a topologically spherical volume with homeotropic boundary conditions.
As established in Chapter~\ref{c:1}, the volume must contain a total hedgehog charge $|d| = 1$.
Using a single defect, this condition can be is satisfied by $d=-1$ hyperbolic point defects or hyperbolic ring defects, shown schematically from the side and top in Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(B,D), and also by $d=+1$ radial point defects or radial ring defects, shown schematically from the side and top in Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(A,C).
The myriad of possible defect configurations gives topologically-confined systems a richness that has been well-explored for the case of geometrically spherical boundaries, where the confinement can only be modified through changing the sphere radius.
For example, topological confinement in spheres can yield self-assembled defect structures involving chains of hedgehog defects~\cite{RN150} or even knotted and entangled line-defect structures~\cite{RN277,RN278,RN275,RN276}.
However, the role of shape when confining NLC in geometries with more than one characteristic lengthscale is not completely understood.

Consider the case of a cylindrical geometry of aspect ratio $\Gamma = 2 R/H$, where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder and $H$ is its height.
With this notation, the classic case of a cylindrical capillary corresponds to $\Gamma \ll 1$. The $\Gamma \gg 1$ situation corresponds to confinement between narrowly separated plates.
When $\Gamma \sim \mathcal{O}\left( 1 \right)$, the equilibrium defect configuration undergoes a transition from a ring defect, found when $\Gamma \gg 1$, to the point defect, seen when $\Gamma \ll 1$.
Prior experimental work investigating this transition used liquid crystal capillary bridges made with 5CB, and reported a transition between a claimed hyperbolic ring defect [see Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(D)] and a claimed radial point defect [see Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(A)]~\cite{RN139,RN147}.

However, we note that Refs.~\cite{RN139,RN147} only observed the bridge structures from above, where the radial and hyperbolic defect structures look the same, as demonstrated schematically in Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(A,B) and Figure~\ref{f:2-3DMeas}(C,D) for ring defects and point defects, respectively.
Prior theoretical work used computational modeling to explore the defect configuration within a cylindrical bridge as a function of $\Gamma$ and $K_{11}/K_{33}$~\cite{RN138,RN144}.
% where $K_{11}$ and $K_{33}$ are the Frank elastic constants corresponding to splay and bend distortions, respectively
For 5CB, which has $K_{11}/K_{33} = 0.74$, they predicted, in contrast to the claims in Refs.~\cite{RN139,RN147}, that the bridge should transition between a radial ring defect and a hyperbolic point defect.

In this Chapter, we address the conflict described in the previous paragraph and perform both experiments and computations pertaining to a confined NLC within a capillary bridge sandwiched between two parallel plates of adjustable separation and hence of varying $\Gamma$.
By observing our experimental bridges from both the top and the side, and comparing our observations with results from our computations, we find that that shape of the free surface controls whether the defect is radial or hyperbolic: waist-like bridges contain hyperbolic defects, and barrel-like bridges contain radial defects.
In addition, we find good agreement between experiment and theory for the critical aspect ratio $\Gamma_c$ at which the defect in the bridge undergoes a transition between a ring defect and a point defect.
Finally, we see that this transition is hysteretic, due to the metastability of the point defect.
Our results clarify the prior discrepancies, and at the same illustrate how shape and elasticity dictate defect structure in confined homeotropic nematics.




\section{Making capillary bridges}
To make a capillary bridge, we confine 5CB between two parallel glass microscope slides.
Prior to use, the slides were dip-coated with $0.1\%$ w/w lecithin (granular, Acros) in hexane ($98.5\%$ purity, BDH) and left to dry to enforce homeotropic anchoring~\cite{RN140}.
We set up an experiment to view a bridge from the top by first placing both microscope slides stacked on top of each other on the microscope stage.
We then epoxy the top plate to a rod affixed to a micromanipulator such that we can adjust the distance between the slides.
Note that this simple protocol ensures that the two microscope slides are parallel to each other and to the microscope stage.
After the epoxy hardens, we raise the top slide and use a glass capillary to place a $\sim$nl-volume drop of 5CB onto the bottom plate.
We then bring the top plate down until it makes contact with the sessile droplet and forms a capillary bridge.

To set up an experiment to view a bridge from the side, we place an uncoated glass slide on the microscope stage to act as a base, and then place a lecithin-coated glass slide vertically on the base and use a pair of blocks to hold it in place.
We then epoxy the lecithin-coated slide to the base, applying epoxy to only one side of the joint between the base and the lecithin-coated slide.
Once the epoxy has hardened, we remove the blocks and place the second lecithin-coated glass slide vertically on the base and flush against the previously-epoxied glass slide.
We then use the rod attached to the micromanipulator to hold the two vertical slides flush while we epoxy the second lecithin-coated glass slide to the rod.
This protocol ensures that the two lecithin-coated glass slides are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the base.
After the epoxy hardens, we use the mircomanipulator to move the adjustable plate as far as possible from the fixed plate and place a $\sim$nl-volume drop of 5CB onto the fixed vertical plate as close to the base as we can.
Finally, we bring the adjustable plate closer to the fixed plate until it makes contact with the sessile drop and forms a capillary bridge.
The final experimental setup for both a top view and a side view is depicted schematically from the side in Figure~\fxnote{F1}(A,B) and in example images in Figure~\fxnote{F1}(C,D), respectively.

As described, this procedure will yield a capillary bridge where the free-surface is in contact with air.
To make a capillary bridge with the free surface in contact with water, we first make a bridge as described above and then pipette a drop of water near the edge of the parallel plates and let capillary action fill the gap between the plates.
The water contains 8 mM SDS to enforce homeotropic anchoring.




\section{Shape of capillary bridges}
We begin by viewing the bridges from the side and characterizing their shapes.
Bridges with air as an outer medium have a waist-like shape with negative Gaussian curvature everywhere on the free surface and bridges with water and SDS as the outer medium have a barrel-like shape.


\subsection{Measuring the shape}
For some example bridges, we record the shape contours on both the left and the right of the bridge as a function of $\Gamma$, where we calculate an effective aspect ratio by taking $R$ as the radius of the circular cross-section of the bridge midway between the two confining plates and taking $H$ as the distance between the plates.
We then plot the contours normalized by the bridge height, with the left contours reflected about the vertical axis, and all contours shifted so that their lowest point corresponds to the origin.
For both the barrels and the waists, the contours all approximately have the same shape regardless of $\Gamma$ or experiment.


\subsection{Constant mean curvature surfaces}
To address the origin of the shape, we consider the relevant forces: the gravitational force $|\mathbf{F}_g| \sim \rho g R^2 H$; the surface tension force $|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}| \sim \gamma H$; and the nematic elasticity force $|\mathbf{F}_K| \sim K$.
The surface tension, density, and Frank elastic constant of 5CB are equal, respectively, to $\gamma \approx 30$ mN/m, $\rho \approx 1$ g/mL, and $K \approx 10^{-11}$ N.
We compare these forces via two dimensionless groups: the Bond number $\rm{Bo} = \dfrac{|\mathbf{F}_g|}{|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|} = \dfrac{\rho g R^2}{\gamma} \sim  \mathcal{O}\left (10^{-2} \right)$, and the elasticity group,
 $\dfrac{|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|}{|\mathbf{F}_K|} =  \dfrac{\gamma H}{K} \sim \mathcal{O}\left (10^{5} \right )$, where we have taken $H = R = 100$ $\mu$m as representative values.
As $|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|$ is the dominant force, the mean curvature of the free surface of the bridge must be constant~\cite{RN178}.
Thus, the contours for a surface of revolution in cylindrical coordinates $\{r,\phi, z\}$ should conform to the expression:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta P = 2 \gamma \left ( \frac{\textrm{d}\Theta}{\textrm{d}s} + \frac{\sin \theta}{r} \right ) = \textrm{cons't},\label{e:5-ConsMeanCurv}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P$ is the Laplace Pressure from Eq.~\ref{e:3-LapPres}, $\gamma$ is the surface tension, and $\Theta$ and $s$ are the elevation angle and arclength parameter, respectively, as defined in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.
This further implies that the contact angle $\theta_0$ between the lecithin-coated glass slide, the outer medium, and the 5CB should set the shape~\cite{RN178}.

To confirm this, we consider each example bridge and numerically solve Eq.~\ref{e:5-ConsMeanCurv} to produce constant-mean curvature contours that capture the envelope of the observed contours for each bridge.
We take $\theta(0)$ and $\delta P$ as initial conditions for each solution, corresponding to setting the contact angle $\theta_0$ and the value of the constant mean curvature.
We average the contact angles from the numerically-solved contours for the waists and barrels to get $\theta^{waist}_0 = 36^{\circ} \pm 8^{\circ}$ and $\theta^{barrel}_0 = 127^{\circ} \pm 9^{\circ}$\fxnote{confirm these}.
We compare the contact angles determined from our calculated contours with contact angles measured from sessile droplets with both air and water as the outer medium, finding $\theta^{air} = 37^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ and $\theta^{water} = 123^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$, in agreement with our data from the bridges.




\section{Defect structure transitions}
We view the bridge from the top to determine whether the defect is a ring or a point; examples of these situations are shown in the bright-field images of a waist-like bridge in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here} and the corresponding crossed-polar images in  Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.


\subsection{Defect transitions in a waist}
We start at large $\Gamma$, where we observe a ring defect, and determine the radius of the ring, $R_{ring}$, as we decrease $\Gamma$ by increasing $H$ in discrete steps.
At each $H$, we monitor the bridge over time to ensure that the defect state no longer changes and the system is in equilibrium.
In addition, as we decrease $\Gamma$ in each bridge, we also determine the effective aspect ratio for the defect transition, $\Gamma_c$.
Using results for 21 different bridges, we find an average $\Gamma_c = 2.7 \pm 0.3$, as shown in the upper contour in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where we have plotted each observation of a stable ring defect with open circles and of a stable point defect with ``x'' symbols.
The ring radius, scaled by the bridge height, varies linearly with $\Gamma$ for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$, as indicated by the squares in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where we have again plotted every measurement we have performed.
At $\Gamma_c$, the  ring becomes unstable, and collapses to a point defect, yielding the discontinuity in $R_{ring}$ shown with a dashed line in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where the point defect is represented as having a vanishing $R_{ring}$.

However, when we start at $\Gamma < \Gamma_c$ in a point defect state and increase $\Gamma$, the point defect never transitions to a ring, as seen in the lower contour in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.
Interestingly, if for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$, we melt the nematic phase in a bridge containing a point defect, we always  recover a ring defect state when we let the bridge cool back to the nematic phase.
This suggests that the point defect is metastable for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$.


\subsection{Defect transitions in a barrel}
Since every barrel-shaped bridge we make initially starts as a waist, we need to make sure the defect state in the waist does not affect the final state in the barrel.
Thus, we make our barrels both from waists with the 5CB in the nematic phase and from waists where the 5CB has been melted to the isotropic before changing the outer medium from air to the water and SDS mixture.
For the barrels made with the 5CB in the isotropic phase, we also heat the water and SDS mixture before making the barrel so that the 5CB does not cool to the nematic phase before the barrel shape has been established.
As with the waist structures, we start with a large $\Gamma$ where the bridge contains a ring defect and decrease $\Gamma$ in discrete steps, measuring the ring radius at each step.
However, over time the SDS forms micelles in the 5CB that self-assemble onto the ring defect and produce filimentary structures in the NLC~\cite{RN279}.
These structures are visible in the crossed-polar images before they are clearly visible in the bright-field images, indicating that they affect the NLC director.
In addition, we see that the self-assembled micelles can even stabilize non-circular ring shapes in some of our measurements, indicating that the SDS is clearly affecting the defect state we measure~\cite{RN279,RN280}.

Thus, we restrict our measurements to ring defects that are circular and centered in the bridge.
We also make sure that the region within the ring in the crossed-polar images is dark, indicating that the SDS has not yet affected the entire bridge.
We then plot the ring radius scaled by the bridge height as a function of measurement number for each bridge, as seen in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where the initial measurement for a bridge is in black, the second measurement for a bridge is in red, the third measurement in blue and the fourth in magenta.
The few magenta and blue points compared to the number of black and red points in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here} indicate that the effect of the micelles grows in time, such that we rarely have good data to make a fourth measurement and we never have good enough data to make a fifth measurement for a given bridge.
Thus, even though for large $\Gamma$ we see that the scaled ring radius varies linearly with $\Gamma$, we cannot make a quantitative prediction about a ring-to-point defect transition in our barrel-shaped bridges.
Even when we make barrels with the 5CB in the isotropic phase with low $\Gamma$, we don't see a clear collapse to a point defect; instead, we typically see see a small ring defect with a scaled ring radius less than $0.3$.
In all our measurements, we see only three examples of a clear point defect in a barrel-shaped bridge.
Finally, we note that we see no difference between barrels made with the 5CB in the nematic phase [filled squares, Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}] and barrels made with 5CB in the isotropic phase [open circles, Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}].





\section{Measuring defect conformation using fluorescence microscopy}
We return to viewing bridges from the side to determine if the defects are radial or hyperbolic.
We start by viewing the bridges with OPM and rotating the crossed polarizer and analyzer; the texture for a radial defect rotates in the same direction as the polarizer and analyzer, while the texture for a hyperbolic defect rotates with the opposite sense~\cite{RN177}.
However, due to the large curvature of the waist and barrel shapes when $\Gamma$ is large, we cannot clearly distinguish the rotation of the texture.
As an alternative approach, we develop and use polarized epifluorescent microscopy (PFM) to see whether the defect is radial or hyperbolic.


\subsection{Theoretical overview of polarized epifluorescent microscopy}
Fluorescence occurs when a material absorbs and then re-emits light, where the initial absorption excites a singlet state in the material which then decays via photon emission.
The realization that this process consists of both absorption and emission of light as well as the name ``fluorescence'' itself is attributed to Stokes~\cite{RN286,RN287}.
However, the understanding that fluorescent emission could be polarized came from work by Weigert with small fluorescent molecules, or fluorophores~\cite{RN285}.
Individual fluorophores and absorb and emit light like dipoles, with the absorption/excitation dipole and the emission dipole not necessarily parallel to each other~\cite{RN282}.
Consequently, while an isotropic distribution of fluorophores will absorb and emit light isotropically, individual fluorophores are sensitive to the polarization of the excitation light and emit light linearly polarized light along emission dipole~\cite{RN282}.

Polarized fluoresence has proven to be an incredibly effective tool in diagnostic imaging and the medical community, from techniques like Foster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), to the myriad of assays designed to measure quantities such as protease content, kinase content, and even cellular or molecular mobility~\cite{RN282,RN284}.
Recently, polarized fluorescence has found new interest in the physics community, with techniques like Polarized Epifluorescent Confocal Microscopy (PCFM), enabling 3D resolution of a liquid-crystalline director~\cite{RN148,RN174}.
Here, we take inspiration from PCFM and develop Polarized Epifluorescent Microscopy (PFM), its wide-field cousin.
As its core, PFM relies on anisotropic fluorophores whose emission axis is aligned along the long axis of the fluorophore.
Introducing the fluorophores in a NLC at low concentrations, the long axis of the fluorophores will align along the nematic director without affecting the director configuration~\cite{RN148,RN174}.
Thus, the fluorescent emission of the mixed fluorophore and NLC system will be linearly polarized along the director.
If we excite the sample with unpolarized light and place an analyzer in the emitted light path, then the emitted intensity from each point in the sample will be $\propto \cos^2{(\Phi_A-\delta)}$, where $\Phi_A$ is the orientation of the analyzer and $\delta$ is the orientation of $\mathbf{n}$ in the plane of the output image~\cite{RN174}.
However, as we use wide-field fluorescent microscopy, the recorded intensity at each point in the output images reflects an averaging of the director along the light path.
Hence, we have sacrificed the three-dimensional spatial resolution of PCFM for the simplicity of PFM.



\subsection{Experimental realization}
We add $0.01$ wt\% Nile red to 5CB; at this concentration, Nile red does not affect the director configuration~\cite{RN173}.
We image our sample using with a standard epifluorescent setup with an analyzer in the emitted light path, as shown schematically from the side in Figure~\fxnote{Fig Here}, with a short-arc lamp as our light source.
We use filter set \#20 from Zeiss, with a 534~nm~--~558~nm bandpass excitation filter, a 560~nm longpass dichroic mirror, and a 575~--~640~nm emission filter ~\cite{RN288}.
For a sample, we record the output intensity $I$ as a function of $\Phi_A$, perform a spatial average using a Gaussian filter, and then fit the intensity as a function of $\Phi_A$ at every pixel to the form:
\begin{equation}
    I = A + B \cos^2{(\Phi_A-\delta')},\label{e:5-IntFit}
\end{equation}
where $A$, $B$ and $\delta'$ are fitting parameters; $A$ and $B$ set the minimum value and range of $I$, respectively, and $\delta'$ reflects an average of the director orientation along the light path.
Using the extracted $\delta'$ values, we can then plot the associated director field for a sample.
Importantly, we note that the dichroic mirror in our filter set is birefringent, as seen in the series of transmitted light images with the polarizer and analyzer crossed and the mirror in the light path. We take the optic axis of the mirror to be $0^{\circ}$; this will set the origin for all our angle measurements.

We initially test our analysis on planar cells; we see that our fit returns good results when the rubbing direction is along $0^{\circ}$ or $90^{\circ}$; in fact our analysis is able to distinguish between the two alignments easily.
However, when the rubbing direction is perfectly parallel to or perpendicular to the optic axis of the dichroic mirror, we see that the fit returns values that are biased towards $0^{\circ}$ or $90^{\circ}$.
Thus, for samples where we wish to distinguish between radial and hyperbolic defects, we will orient the samples with the symmetry axis of the defect at $45^{\circ}$ to maximize our ability to determine the director at the most important parts of the texture.
We also melt the 5Cb in the cell to the isotropic to ensure that there is no appreciable intensity variation with changing $\Phi_A$.
