\chapter{Homeotropic nematics confined in capillary bridges}

\section{Introduction}
The research presented so far has focused on nematic materials confined by toroidal surfaces.
Here we consider a NLC confined to a topologically spherical volume with homeotropic boundary conditions.
As established in Chapter~\ref{c:1}, the volume must contain a total hedgehog charge $|d| = 1$.
There are a myriad of possible defect configurations for such a topologically-confined system, from the simple configuration of a single radial hedgehog~\cite{RN177}, to far more complicated defect structures involving chains of hedgehog defects~\cite{RN150} or even knotted and entangled line-defect structures~\cite{RN277,RN278}.
All of these well-understood~\cite{RN93,RN275,RN276} examples involve geometrically spherical boundaries, where the confinement can only be modified through changing the sphere radius.
However, the role of shape when confining NLC in geometries with more than one characteristic lengthscale is not completely understood.

Consider the case of a cylindrical geometry of aspect ratio $\Gamma = 2 R/H$, where $R$ is the radius of the cylinder and $H$ is its height.
With this notation, the classic case of a cylindrical capillary corresponds to $\Gamma \ll 1$. The $\Gamma \gg 1$ situation corresponds to confinement between narrowly separated plates.
When $\Gamma \sim \mathcal{O}\left( 1 \right)$, the equilibrium defect configuration undergoes a transition from a ring defect, found when $\Gamma \gg 1$, to the point defect, seen when $\Gamma \ll 1$.
Prior experimental work investigating this transition used liquid crystal capillary bridges made with 5CB, and reported a transition between a claimed hyperbolic ring defect [see Figs.~1\emph{A},\emph{C}] and a claimed radial point defect [see Figs.~1\emph{E},\emph{F}]~\cite{RN139,RN147}.

However, we note that Refs.~\cite{RN139,RN147} only observed the bridge structures from above, where the radial and hyperbolic defect structures look the same, as demonstrated schematically in Fig. 1\emph{C} and Fig. 1\emph{F} for ring defects and point defects, respectively.
Prior theoretical work used computational modeling to explore the defect configuration within a cylindrical bridge as a function of $\Gamma$ and $K_{11}/K_{33}$~\cite{RN138,RN144}.
% where $K_{11}$ and $K_{33}$ are the Frank elastic constants corresponding to splay and bend distortions, respectively
For 5CB, which has $K_{11}/K_{33} = 0.74$, they predicted, in contrast to the claims in Refs.~\cite{RN139,RN147}, that the bridge should transition between a radial ring defect and a hyperbolic point defect.

In this Chapter, we address the conflict described in the previous paragraph and perform both experiments and computations pertaining to a confined NLC within a capillary bridge sandwiched between two parallel plates of adjustable separation and hence of varying $\Gamma$.
By observing our experimental bridges from both the top and the side, and comparing our observations with results from our computations, we find that that shape of the free surface controls whether the defect is radial or hyperbolic: waist-like bridges contain hyperbolic defects, and barrel-like bridges contain radial defects.
In addition, we find good agreement between experiment and theory for the critical aspect ratio $\Gamma_c$ at which the defect in the bridge undergoes a transition between a ring defect and a point defect.
Finally, we see that this transition is hysteretic, due to the metastability of the point defect.
Our results clarify the prior discrepancies, and at the same illustrate how shape and elasticity dictate defect structure in confined homeotropic nematics.




\section{Making capillary bridges}
To make a capillary bridge, we confine 5CB between two parallel glass microscope slides.
Prior to use, the slides were dip-coated with $0.1\%$ w/w lecithin (granular, Acros) in hexane ($98.5\%$ purity, BDH) and left to dry to enforce homeotropic anchoring~\cite{RN140}.
We set up an experiment to view a bridge from the top by first placing both microscope slides stacked on top of each other on the microscope stage.
We then epoxy the top plate to a rod affixed to a micromanipulator such that we can adjust the distance between the slides.
Note that this simple protocol ensures that the two microscope slides are parallel to each other and to the microscope stage.
After the epoxy hardens, we raise the top slide and use a glass capillary to place a $\sim$nl-volume drop of 5CB onto the bottom plate.
We then bring the top plate down until it makes contact with the sessile droplet and forms a capillary bridge.

To set up an experiment to view a bridge from the side, we place an uncoated glass slide on the microscope stage to act as a base, and then place a lecithin-coated glass slide vertically on the base and use a pair of blocks to hold it in place.
We then epoxy the lecithin-coated slide to the base, applying epoxy to only one side of the joint between the base and the lecithin-coated slide.
Once the epoxy has hardened, we remove the blocks and place the second lecithin-coated glass slide vertically on the base and flush against the previously-epoxied glass slide.
We then use the rod attached to the micromanipulator to hold the two vertical slides flush while we epoxy the second lecithin-coated glass slide to the rod.
This protocol ensures that the two lecithin-coated glass slides are parallel to each other and perpendicular to the base.
After the epoxy hardens, we use the mircomanipulator to move the adjustable plate as far as possible from the fixed plate and place a $\sim$nl-volume drop of 5CB onto the fixed vertical plate as close to the base as we can.
Finally, we bring the adjustable plate closer to the fixed plate until it makes contact with the sessile drop and forms a capillary bridge.
The final experimental setup for both a top view and a side view is depicted schematically from the side in Figure~\fxnote{F1}(A,B) and in example images in Figure~\fxnote{F1}(C,D), respectively.

As described, this procedure will yield a capillary bridge where the free-surface is in contact with air.
To make a capillary bridge with the free surface in contact with water, we first make a bridge as described above and then pipette a drop of water near the edge of the parallel plates and let capillary action fill the gap between the plates.
The water contains 8 mM SDS to enforce homeotropic anchoring.




\section{Shape of capillary bridges}
We begin by viewing the bridges from the side and characterizing their shapes.
Bridges with air as an outer medium have a waist-like shape with negative Gaussian curvature everywhere on the free surface and bridges with water and SDS as the outer medium have a barrel-like shape.


\subsection{Measuring the shape}
For some example bridges, we record the shape contours on both the left and the right of the bridge as a function of $\Gamma$, where we calculate an effective aspect ratio by taking $R$ as the radius of the circular cross-section of the bridge midway between the two confining plates and taking $H$ as the distance between the plates.
We then plot the contours normalized by the bridge height, with the left contours reflected about the vertical axis, and all contours shifted so that their lowest point corresponds to the origin.
For both the barrels and the waists, the contours all approximately have the same shape regardless of $\Gamma$ or experiment.


\subsection{Constant mean curvature surfaces}
To address the origin of the shape, we consider the relevant forces: the gravitational force $|\mathbf{F}_g| \sim \rho g R^2 H$; the surface tension force $|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}| \sim \gamma H$; and the nematic elasticity force $|\mathbf{F}_K| \sim K$.
The surface tension, density, and Frank elastic constant of 5CB are equal, respectively, to $\gamma \approx 30$ mN/m, $\rho \approx 1$ g/mL, and $K \approx 10^{-11}$ N.
We compare these forces via two dimensionless groups: the Bond number $\rm{Bo} = \dfrac{|\mathbf{F}_g|}{|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|} = \dfrac{\rho g R^2}{\gamma} \sim  \mathcal{O}\left (10^{-2} \right)$, and the elasticity group,
 $\dfrac{|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|}{|\mathbf{F}_K|} =  \dfrac{\gamma H}{K} \sim \mathcal{O}\left (10^{5} \right )$, where we have taken $H = R = 100$ $\mu$m as representative values.
As $|\mathbf{F}_{\gamma}|$ is the dominant force, the mean curvature of the free surface of the bridge must be constant~\cite{RN178}.
Thus, the contours for a surface of revolution in cylindrical coordinates $\{r,\phi, z\}$ should conform to the expression:
\begin{equation}
  \Delta P = 2 \gamma \left ( \frac{\textrm{d}\Theta}{\textrm{d}s} + \frac{\sin \theta}{r} \right ) = \textrm{cons't},\label{e:5-ConsMeanCurv}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta P$ is the Laplace Pressure from Eq.~\ref{e:3-LapPres}, $\gamma$ is the surface tension, and $\Theta$ and $s$ are the elevation angle and arclength parameter, respectively, as defined in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.
This further implies that the contact angle $\theta_0$ between the lecithin-coated glass slide, the outer medium, and the 5CB should set the shape~\cite{RN178}.

To confirm this, we consider each example bridge and numerically solve Eq.~\ref{e:5-ConsMeanCurv} to produce constant-mean curvature contours that capture the envelope of the observed contours for each bridge.
We take $\theta(0)$ and $\delta P$ as initial conditions for each solution, corresponding to setting the contact angle $\theta_0$ and the value of the constant mean curvature.
We average the contact angles from the numerically-solved contours for the waists and barrels to get $\theta^{waist}_0 = 36^{\circ} \pm 8^{\circ}$ and $\theta^{barrel}_0 = 127^{\circ} \pm 9^{\circ}$\fxnote{confirm these}.
We compare the contact angles determined from our calculated contours with contact angles measured from sessile droplets with both air and water as the outer medium, finding $\theta^{air} = 37^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$ and $\theta^{water} = 123^{\circ} \pm 5^{\circ}$, in agreement with our data from the bridges.




\section{Defect structure transitions}
We view the bridge from the top to determine whether the defect is a ring or a point; examples of these situations are shown in the bright-field images of a waist-like bridge in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here} and the corresponding crossed-polar images in  Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.


\subsection{Defect transitions in a waist}
We start at large $\Gamma$, where we observe a ring defect, and determine the radius of the ring, $R_{ring}$, as we decrease $\Gamma$ by increasing $H$ in discrete steps.
At each $H$, we monitor the bridge over time to ensure that the defect state no longer changes and the system is in equilibrium.
In addition, as we decrease $\Gamma$ in each bridge, we also determine the effective aspect ratio for the defect transition, $\Gamma_c$.
Using results for 21 different bridges, we find an average $\Gamma_c = 2.7 \pm 0.3$, as shown in the upper contour in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where we have plotted each observation of a stable ring defect with open circles and of a stable point defect with ``x'' symbols.
The ring radius, scaled by the bridge height, varies linearly with $\Gamma$ for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$, as indicated by the squares in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where we have again plotted every measurement we have performed.
At $\Gamma_c$, the  ring becomes unstable, and collapses to a point defect, yielding the discontinuity in $R_{ring}$ shown with a dashed line in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}, where the point defect is represented as having a vanishing $R_{ring}$.

However, when we start at $\Gamma < \Gamma_c$ in a point defect state and increase $\Gamma$, the point defect never transitions to a ring, as seen in the lower contour in Figure~\fxnote{Fig here}.
Interestingly, if for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$, we melt the nematic phase in a bridge containing a point defect, we always  recover a ring defect state when we let the bridge cool back to the nematic phase.
This suggests that the point defect is metastable for $\Gamma > \Gamma_c$.


\subsection{Defect transitions in a barrel}
Since every barrel-shaped bridge we make initially starts as a waist, we need to make sure the defect state in the waist does not affect the final state in the barrel.
Thus, we melt the 5CB to the isotropic before we change the outer medium from air to the water and SDS mixture.
We then adjust $\Gamma$ to the desired starting value while the 5CB is still in the isotropic phase, let the 5CB cool to the nematic phase, and wait until the nematic texture has equilibrated before beginning an experiment.
As with the waist structures, we start with a large $\Gamma$ where the bridge contains a ring defect and decrease $\Gamma$ in discrete steps.
We measure that the ring radius scaled with the bridge height varies linearly with $\Gamma$, similar to the waist-shaped bridges.
However, in contrast to the waist-shaped bridges, we do not find a transition to a point defect for the values of $\Gamma$ we can attain; for low enough $\Gamma$ the bridge break.
In addition, over time the SDS forms micelles in the 5CB that self-assemble onto the ring defect and produce filimentary structures in the NLC.
These structures are visible in the crossed-polar images before they are clearly visible in the bright-field images, indicating that they affect the NLC director.
In addition, we see that the self-assembled micelles add elasticity to the ring defect, even stabilizing non-circular ring shapes.

To minimize the effect of the SDS micelles on our measurements, we restrict ourselves to a single measurement for every barrel we construct; thus, the defect state in each barrel is only characterized for the initial $\Gamma$ where the 5CB cools from the isotropic to the nematic.
