\chapter{Homeotropic nematics confined in toroids and bent capillaries}

\section{Introduction}

when a system breaks reflection symmetry is establishes a handedness
ex, isomers, chirality, parity, etc

chiralityt is imortant
  -fund phys v... parity, isomers of molecules, chiral structures
  -optical activity, self-organized systems
generate chirality from achiral building blocks
  -SSB
  -liquid crystals
  -elasticity-driven symm breaking
    -twist-bend instability, regular cylinder homeo
  -LC sensitive to curvature
    -K24, planar anchoring, increase twist by taking cylinder to a torus
demonstrate in the absence of an explicit curvature-coupling term, can still induce twist by inducing extra bend.
