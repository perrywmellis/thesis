note = {The tracking minimizes $\sum_i \delta_i$, where $\delta_i$ is the
distance between the i$^{\rm th}$ particle in one image and a candidate particle in the
subsequent image. For $N$ particles, this scales like $\mathcal{O}(N!)$; to reduce runtime,
the algorithm has a cutoff length $L$, considering possible candidates only
where $\delta_i < L$.}

note = {At each timestep, a random acceleration, or kick, is added to the equations of motion;
each kick is drawn indepently from the same probability distribution.}
