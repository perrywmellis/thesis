\chapter{Introduction}\label{c:1}
At high temperature, an isolated collection of molecules at a low enough volume fraction is a fluid and thus is a uniform system; the probability of finding any molecule at any specific position is a constant and only depends on the density of the particles.
As this system is invariant under all possible rotations and translations, we say that the system has complete continuous translational and rotational symmetry.
If we lower the temperature, the system will eventually develop order, where the individual molecules have a preferred local arrangement.
For this example, lowering the temperature will eventually force the system to transition from a fluid phase to a crystalline phase, where the molecule positions make up a periodic lattice.
Thus, the system is now only invariant with respect to a discrete set of translations and rotations.
Here, the system breaks the continuous symmetry of the isotropic phase in order to achieve the crystalline phase.
Hence, the ordered phase has lower symmetry than the isotropic phase.

The advent of order as a result of continuous symmetry breaking is general and is a hallmark of transitions between a multitude of different phases.
In addition, the phases do not have to be formed by collections of molecules; they can be built from a variety of constituent units, from angstrom-scale atoms to micron-scale colloids or even larger building blocks.
Regardless of the nature of the constituent particles, the isotropic-to-crystalline phase transition in three-dimensions (3D) breaks continuous translational and rotational symmetry in all directions.
However, a system can also transition from an isotropic phase to a phase where the continuous translational and rotational symmetry in not broken in all directions.
For example, an isotropic-to-smectic phase transition in 3D breaks continuous translation symmetry in only one direction and continuous rotational symmetry in two directions, while the isotropic-to-uniaxial nematic and isotropic-to-ferromagnetic transitions break no translational symmetries and only break rotational symmetry in two directions~\cite{RN175}.
Breaking continuous translational symmetry results in positional order while breaking continuous rotational symmetry results in orientational order.

  \caption{Smectic and nematic order.
  (A), A smectic phase breaks translational symmetry along one direction, leading to a layer-like structure.
  For the drawn Smectic-A phase, this direction is indicated by $\bm{\nu}$.
  (B), A uniaxial nematic phase has continuous translational symmetry in all directions and continuous rotational symmetry in one direction. This direction is indicated by the director, $\mathbf{n}$.}\label{f:1-SmecticNematic}
\end{figure}

With the development of order comes the rigidity needed to maintain that order.
For example, crystalline and smectic materials do not flow easily due to their broken translational symmetries.
However, nematics with their continuous translational symmetries flow far easier; the constituent particles only need to maintain their orientation and not their position.
In addition, systems with anisotropic order must have a correspondingly anisotropic rigidity.
Consider a smectic phase with its broken translational symmetry in one direction, given by the unit vector $\bm{\nu}$, as drawn schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-SmecticNematic}(A).
Along $\bm{\nu}$, the material will resist flow like a crystal, but will flow easily like a fluid along directions orthogonal to $\bm{\nu}$.
Similarly, even though a uniaxial nematic has continuous translation symmetry in all directions, it still has rigidity as the nematic must maintain its two-fold orientational order, as illustrated schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-SmecticNematic}(B).
This rigidity is thus anisotropic, reflecting the nematic's anisotropic rotational symmetry.
This phenomenon is not limited to the rigidity; in general, the properties of a phase will reflect its symmetries.
For example, ordered materials often exhibit birefringence, where the index of refraction is anisotropic.
A light wave incident on a birefringent material will thus encounter an index of refraction that depends on the direction and polarization of the light wave~\cite{RN175}.

Ordered materials can also have defects, defined generally as locations in the material where the preferred local arrangement is not satisfied.
Belying their name, defects are not necessarily undesirable; in fact, they can have important consequences for the physics of the phase, and thus can be exploited to achieve specific properties.
For example, joining two crystalline domains of incompatible orientations results in defects forming a border, or grain boundary, between the two domains.
In a crystalline material, these grain boundaries affect the moduli of the material, and are even responsible for the phenomenon of ``work hardening,'' where plastically deforming the material increases the magnitude of the shear modulus.
This is commonly done to create durable objects and sculptures from copper and other ductile metals.
The plastic deformations cause isolated defects and grain boundaries to proliferate within the material; however, as the defect density rises, so does the energy required to generate each new defect.
This results in an increased resistance to deformation that further reflects in the increase of the shear modulus.

In addition, defects can also directly mediate phase transitions, as in the celebrated Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory of melting in 2D~\cite{RN161,RN162,RN163}.
Here, the increase in symmetry when a 2D crystalline phase melts to the isotropic phase is a two-step process.
First, pairs of rotational defects, or disclinations~\cite{RN61,RN203}, proliferate, driving the crystalline phase into an intermediate hexatic phase characterized by six-fold orientational order.
Second, these disclination pairs unbind, transforming the hexatic phase into the isotropic phase.
Furthermore, defects in soft matter have been used as tools to investigate a wide range of phenomena from knot theory~\cite{RN156,RN277} to controlled self-assembly~\cite{RN43,RN50,RN150,RN157}, to hierarchical materials~\cite{RN164,RN159,RN27}.

Apart from both their effect on physical systems and their use as tools, defects are fascinating objects in their own right as they are extremely sensitive to the intrinsic geometry of the space they inhabit.
Consider, for example, densely packing rods on a plane.
In order to maximize the entropy of the system, the rods need to align along the same direction, breaking continuous rotational symmetry and yielding the the two-fold order of the uniaxial nematic phase~\cite{RN204}.
We can characterize this preferred local alignment with a director, $\mathbf{n}$, where $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{-n}$, reflecting the inversion symmetry of the 2-fold order.
Clearly, it is easy to fill space on the plane with a homogeneous director field, as shown schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-RodsPlane}(A).
However, if we now try to pack rods on the surface of a sphere, for example along either the latitude or longitude lines of the Earth's globe [Figure~\ref{f:1-RodsPlane}(B)], we see that there are defects in the order that correspond to the singular points at the poles, where $\mathbf{n}$ is undefined.
Since you ``cannot comb a hairy ball,'' the presence of singularities is no accident --- it is a consequence of confining the nematic to the surface with the topology of a sphere~\cite{RN209,RN169}.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/C1/Ch1-Figs_RodsPlane.png}
  \caption{Packing rods in two dimensions.
  (A-C), Rod-like particles preferentially align along a commmon axis, given by the black lines.
  (A) On a plane, the alignment can be homogeneous everywhere.
  (B,C) On a sphere, there must be singularities (${\color{red} \bullet}$) in the alignment directions, as shown for alighment directions along (B) the latitude or longitude lines on a globe and an alignment direction along (C) the stitching on a baseball.
  Note that there while only one singularity is visible in (B,C), there are 2 singularities in (B) and 4 in (C).}\label{f:1-RodsPlane}
\end{figure}

To formally relate the topology of the sphere with the presence of singularities, we need a few topological notions.
The sphere is an example of a differentiable surface that is compact, has no boundary, and is orientable.
Compact surfaces must both be bounded and contain their limit points.
Here, the term ``bounded'' means the surface has some finite size and is distinct from whether or not the surface has a boundary.
The boundary of a surface is defined as the set of points that can be approached from both the interior and the exterior of the surface.
Finally, orientable surfaces have a defined normal vector everywhere.
For example, 2D Euclidean space, denoted as $\mathbb{R}^2$, is a surface but it is not bounded and thus it is not compact.
Given $\mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^2$, the 2D open unit disc $|\mathbf{r}| < d$ is not compact since it does not contain the circle with radius $d$.
However, the 2D unit disc $|\mathbf{r}| \leq d$ satisfies both conditions and thus is compact.
In addition, we see that $|\mathbf{r}| \leq d$ has a boundary $\partial \mathbf{r}$ at $|\mathbf{r}| = d$, as $\partial \mathbf{r}$ can be approached by points in both the interior and the exterior of the disc.
We call compact surfaces without a boundary closed surfaces.
Finally, all of these examples are also orientable; it is trivial to define the surface normal everywhere.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/C1/Ch1-Figs_ChiObjects.png}
  \caption{Closed surfaces with the same Euler characteristic are homeomorphic. (A,B) Closed surfaces with no handle like a (A) sphere and a (B) cup can be continuously deformed into each other.
  (C,D) Closed surfaces with a single handle like a (C) torus and a (D) coffee mug can be continuously deformed into each other.
  However, the surfaces in (A,B) cannot be continuously deformed in the surfaces in (C,D) as the process of adding a handle breaks the surface.}\label{f:1-ChiObjects}
\end{figure}

We characterize the topological properties of a surface with its Euler characteristic, $\chi$, which we can calculate using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem.
For a closed surface, the theorem states that~\cite{RN23}:
\begin{equation}
  \chi = 2(1-g),\label{e:1-GB1}
\end{equation}
where $g$ is the genus, or number of handles, of the surface.
The Euler characteristic is a topological invariant --- continuously deforming a surface, i.e.\ under a homeomorphism, does not change its Euler characteristic.
A homeomorphism is continuous function with a continuous inverse that maps between topological spaces while preserving topological properties.
For example, a sphere has no handles, thus $g = 0$ and $\chi=2$.
Since a homeomorphism preserves the topological properties, any surface with $g=0$ is topologically equivalent, or homeomorphic, to the sphere, and therefore also has $\chi=2$.
For example, as pictured in Figure~\ref{f:1-ChiObjects}(A,B), a sphere is homeomorphic to a cup, as neither have handles.
Similarly, the torus and the coffee mug pictured in Figure~\ref{f:1-ChiObjects}(C,D), respectively, are also homeomorphic to each other.
However, the sphere [Figure~\ref{f:1-ChiObjects}(A)] and the torus [Figure~\ref{f:1-ChiObjects}(C)] are not homeomorphic as we cannot add a handle to the sphere without breaking its surface.

Thus, we can extend the statement, ``you cannot comb a hairy ball'' to, ``you cannot comb a hairy surface with $\chi=2$.''
In fact, any attempt to do so will necessarily result in the presence of singularities.
In an orientation field like a director field, singularities are called ``disclinations''.
We can characterize a disclination by how much the director rotates along a closed contour encircling the disclination.
For a contour $\partial A$ and the angle $\phi(\mathbf{r})$ parameterizing the director field, with $\mathbf{r}$ the position vectors of a point on the surface, we can calculate~\cite{RN23,RN153,RN203}:
\begin{equation}
  s = \frac{1}{2 \pi}\oint_{\partial A} \textrm{d}\mathbf{r} \cdot \nabla\phi(\mathbf{r}) = \frac{1}{2\pi} \oint_{\partial A} \textrm{d} \phi,\label{eq:1-topCharge}
\end{equation}
where $\textrm{d}\phi$ is an exact differential.
However, since $\phi$ is not a single-valued function, $\phi$ is not conservative and $s$ is not path independent.
If we map $\phi$ on $\partial A$ onto points on $\mathbb{S}^1$, the unit circle, we see that $s$ is the number of times the director field wraps the unit circle.
Since we cannot eliminate the enclosed disclination with continuous deformations of the director, disclinations are topological and $s$ is known as the winding number, or ``topological charge.''
Regardless of aligning rods along the latitudes or the longitudes on the Earth's globe, the director along a contour encircling either pole rotates by $2 \pi$, as depicted in Figure~\ref{f:1-TopCharge}(A).
Thus, both the north and the south poles have charge $s = +1$, bringing the total charge on the surface to $+2$.
The formal statement connecting a vector or director field on a closed surface with the topology of the surface is the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem~\cite{RN23}:
\begin{equation}
  \sum\limits_{i = 1}^{N} s_i = \chi,\label{e:1-PH}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is the number of disclinations, each of topological charge $s_i$.

Thus, for nematic order, $s \in n/2$, where $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, the integers; however, for polar order, $s = n$.
For example, the defect structure in Figure~\ref{f:1-TopCharge}(B) has $s = +1/2$ and can exist in a nematic director field, where $\mathbf{n} = \mathbf{-n}$.
Attempting to construct such a disclination with a vector field, as illustrated by following the vectors as they go from blue to cyan along the red contour in Figure~\ref{f:1-TopCharge}(C), we see that we get a $\pi$-flip and the vector field is not continuous.
Note also that the Poincar\'e-Hopf Theorem only requires the total charge on the surface to be equal to $\chi$; we can construct a director or a vector field on a closed surface with any combination of defects so long as the total topological charge is equal to $\chi$.
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/C1/Ch1-Figs_TopCharge.png}
  \caption{Topological charge of disclinations.
  (A), The director rotates by $2\pi$ along the contour enclosing the singularity (${\color{red} \bullet}$), giving $s = +1$ for both disclinations.
  (B) The director rotates by $\pi$ along the contour enclosing the singularity (${\color{red} \bullet}$), giving $s = +1/2$.
  (C) Attempting to construct an $s = +1/2$ disclination for a vector field results in a discontinuity in the vector field along the contour.
  This is seen by following the red contour as the vectors go from blue to cyan.}\label{f:1-TopCharge}
\end{figure}

Physical ordered systems constrained to a closed surface must then minimize their free energy while complying with the constraint imposed by the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem.
For an orientationally ordered phase where the particles prefer to align parallel to each other, we can write the free energy as the cost of distorting the material from the homogeneously-aligned state.
In the continuum limit, this distortion free energy is a functional of the orientation field,
\begin{equation}
  F_d = \frac{1}{2} k_F \int \textrm{d}^2\mathbf{r} \, |\nabla \phi(\mathbf{r})|^2,\label{e:2-XY}
\end{equation}
where $k_F$ is the elastic constant governing the cost of distortion.
If we have polar order described by a vector field, then Eq.~\ref{e:2-XY} is the classical 2D X-Y model governing spins on a fixed lattice~\cite{RN175}; for nematic order, Eq.~\ref{e:2-XY} is the 2D Frank-Oseen free energy~\cite{RN61} in the 1-constant approximation~\cite{RN33}.

Nematics on a sphere were predicted~\cite{RN42,RN104,RN43} to minimize the free energy not with two $s=+1$ defects [Figure~\ref{f:1-RodsPlane}(B)] but with four $s=+1/2$ defects arranged on the vertices of a tetrahedron [Figure~\ref{f:1-RodsPlane}(C)].
Prior work in our group addressed this situation experimentally using glass-based microfluidic devices to fabricate double emulsions~\cite{RN272}, with a shell of nematic liquid crystal (NLC) between an inner water droplet and an outer water continuous phase~\cite{RN105,RN45}.
By decreasing the osmotic pressure in the outer continuous phase of the nematic shells, swelling of the inner droplet was induced.
This swelling decreased the thickness of the NLC shell to create an experimental realization of a 2D nematic on the surface of a sphere~\cite{RN45}.
In this thin shell limit, the four $s = +1/2$ defects arranged on the vertices of a tetrahedron was observed; see Figure~\ref{f:1-Shells}(A,B).
\begin{figure}
  \centering
  \includegraphics{figures/C1/Ch1-Figs_Shells.png}
  \caption{Shells of nematic liquid crystal.
  (A-C) Thin shells of NLC have four $s = +1/2$ defects, with an experimental crossed-polar image in (A), the tetrahedron highlighted in (B), and a cross-section schematically showing the director configuration in (C).
  The cross-section is of a great circle containing two $s = +1/2$ defects (${\color{red} \bullet}$) on both the inner and outer surface of the shell, with a red singular line connecting corresponding disclinations.
  The disclinations occupy the vertices of a tetrahedron and thus are separated by $109^{\circ}$ in the cross-section.
  (D) Cross-section of the director configuration in a thick shell. Here, the two $s = +1$ disclinations (${\color{red} \bullet}$) on each surface are no longer connected by a singular line.
  (E,F) As $R^{in}\rightarrow 0$, the thick shell becomes a bipolar droplet, with a cross-section of the director field in (E) and a corresponding crossed-polar image in (F).}\label{f:1-Shells}
\end{figure}

However, this tetrahedral arrangement of $s = +1/2$ defects only exists in thin enough shells, as characterized by the relative shell thickness $h' = (R^{out}-R^{in})/R^{out}$, with $R^{in}$ and $R^{out}$ the inner and outer radius of the nematic shell, as defined schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-Shells}(C).
As $h'$ increases, the shell also becomes inhomogeneous due to density differences between the inner droplet and the NLC shell.
This thickness heterogeneity drives defects to the thinnest portion of the shell; this means that the $s = +1/2$ defects are no longer arranged in a tetrahedron.
In addition, as $h'$ increases, the shell can no longer be considered 2D.

The situation is now 3D and there are two spherical interfaces where the topological charge on the interface is constrained by the Poincar\'e-Hopf theorem, with a bulk region between the two surfaces filled with NLC.
Each $s = +1/2$ defect on the outer surface is connected to a corresponding $s = +1/2$ disclination on the inner surface via a singular line that propagates through the bulk.
This is depicted schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-Shells}(C) for a great circle containing two $s = +1/2$ disclinations on each surface.
As $h'$ increases, so does the cost of each singular line.
Eventually, as $h'\gtrsim 1/2$, the cost of propagating the singular lines through the bulk is too great and pairs of $s = +1/2$ disclinations on each surface transition to one $s = +1$ disclination~\cite{RN105}, known as a boojum~\cite{RN273}.

Unlike the $s = +1/2$ defects, the corresponding boojums on the inner and outer surface are not connected by a singular line; instead, the director in the shell region ``escapes in the third dimension'' and acquires a component along the radius of the droplet, removing all the singularities in the bulk.
The increased energetic cost of a single boojum as compared to two $s = +1/2$ defects is compensated by the energetic decrease of removing the singular regions in the bulk of the shell.
This is depicted schematically for a two boojums on each surface for the special case of a homogeneous shell in Figure~\ref{f:1-Shells}(D).
For a heterogeneous thickness, the boojums will migrate towards the thinnest portion of the shell.
In addition, the shells are not restricted to either four $s = +1/2$ disclinations or two $s = +1$ boojums; our group also observed hybrid shells with two $s = +1/2$ disclinations and a single boojum.
For $h' = 1$, there is no inner water droplet and we have a single droplet of NLC in a continuous water phase, with the boojums on opposite poles.
This director arrangement is the classic bipolar configuration, with the director field and associated crossed polar image shown in Figure~\ref{f:1-Shells}(E,F), respectively.

This example shows that even if Eq.~\ref{e:2-XY} favors a homogeneous orientation field, corresponding to the zero energy configuration, sometimes distortions are unavoidable due to the topological constraints imposed by the surface.
However, ordered materials are also sensitive to the local geometry.
For example, consider once more rods packed on a plane with a homogeneous director field, as shown schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-ParallelTransport}(A).
If we change the geometry and introduce a hemispherical ``bump'' in the plane, as illustrated in Figure~\ref{f:1-ParallelTransport}(B), evenly-spaced director lines on the plane do not maintain their spacing on the bump.
Thus, we no longer have a homogeneous director everywhere on the surface.
This inability to maintain the preferred local order due to the geometry of the surface is called ``geometrical frustration''.
Geometrical frustration is also commonly seen in magnetic systems.
For example, it is impossible to have a triangular antiferromagnetic lattice; the topology of the lattice frustrates the local antiferromagnetic order, as illustrated schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-ParallelTransport}(D).
\begin{figure}

\end{figure}

An important aspect of the local geometry of a surface is its curvature; consider a curve constrained to lie in $\mathbb{R}^2$, $\mathbf{r}(s)$, with $s$ the arclength parameter.
Such an example of a planar curve is drawn schematically in Figure~\ref{f:1-Curvature}(A).
The unit tangent to the curve at $s$ is given by $\mathbf{T}(s) = \textrm{d} \mathbf{r}(s)/\textrm{d}s = \mathbf{r}'(s)$, and the local curvature $\kappa(s)$ by $\mathbf{k}(s)\kappa(s) = \mathbf{T}'(s) = \mathbf{r}''(s) $, with $\mathbf{k}(s)$ the unit normal vector to the curve [see Figure~\ref{f:1-Curvature}(A)].
$\kappa(s) = 1/R(s)$, where $R(s)$ is the radius of the osculating circle, or circle that best approximates $\mathbf{r}(s)$ at $s$.
This radius is commonly known as the ``radius of curvature'' at $s$.
The sign of the curvature relates to the direction $\mathbf{k}$ rotates as $s$ increases: if $\mathbf{k}$ rotates counterclockwise, then $\kappa > 0$, while if $\mathbf{k}$ rotates clockwise, $\kappa < 0$.
The osculating circles and associated radii of curvature are drawn in blue and red in Figure~\ref{f:1-Curvature}(A) for a point with negative curvature and a point with positive curvature.

Now consider a 2D orientable surface given by $\mathbf{R}(u^1,u^2) \in \mathbb{R}^3$, with $(u^1,u^2) \in U \subset \mathbb{R}^2$ local coordinates on the surface, with $U$ a local coordinate patch.
We define a normal section at a point $\mathbf{r} \in U$ on the surface as the planar curve resulting from the intersection between the surface and a plane containing.
Since the orientation of the plane is not unique, there are infinitely many planes that can contain $\mathbf{k}(\mathbf{r})$, and therefore infinitely many normal sections at a given point $\mathbf{r}$.
The curvature of a given normal section at $\mathbf{r}$ is called the normal curvature.
A normal section, the plane containing $\mathbf{k}$, and the osculating circle whose $R$ determines the normal curvature $\kappa(s)$ are drawn schematically for an example surface in Figure~\ref{f:1-Curvature}(B).
Among all possible normal curvatures at $\mathbf{r}$, there is always a maximum and minimum normal curvature, with the planes containing the associated normal sections orthogonal to each other~\cite{RN35}.
These two curvatures are the principle curvatures at $\mathbf{r}$, $\kappa_1 (\mathbf{r})$ and $\kappa_2(\mathbf{r})$, and their associated tangent vectors at $\mathbf{r}$ are the principal directions; these directions and curvatures are drawn schematically for an example surface in Figure~\ref{f:1-Curvature}(C).
For $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, we define two important quantities: the Gaussian curvature $K  = \kappa_1 \kappa_2$ and the mean curvature $H = (1/2) (\kappa_1+\kappa_2)$.

We now see that adding the hemispherical bump to the plane, which has $K = H = 0$ everywhere, changes the geometry by adding both non-zero mean and Gaussian curvature.
However, it is the Gaussian curvature and not the mean curvature that is responsible for geometrical frustration.
This can be seen after modulating the flat plane with a sine wave in one direction, as shown in Figure~\ref{f:1-ParallelTransport}(C).
In this case, $K=0$ everywhere while $H$ changes throughout the surface.
Despite the fact that $H \neq 0$ everywhere, we can still maintain a homogeneous director field, in contrast to our example surface with $K \neq 0$ at the bump [Figure~\ref{f:1-ParallelTransport}(B)].
This is a reflection of the fact that Gaussian curvature is a property of the surface alone, that is, it is an intrinsic curvature.
We can determine the Gaussian curvature of a surface without knowing anything about the space the surface is embedded in.
In contrast, determining the mean, or extrinsic, curvature of a surface requires knowledge of the space the surface is embedded in.

Revisiting the Euler characteristic, we can rewrite the Gauss-Bonnet theorem for a differentiable closed surface as,
\begin{equation}
  \chi = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \int \, K \textrm{d}^2\mathbf{r} = 2(1-g)\label{e:1-GB2}.
\end{equation}
It is evident from Eq.~\ref{e:1-GB2} that the Gaussian curvature provides the connection between the local geometry and the topology of a closed surface.
This is a very important fact.
Even though $K$ is a property of the local geometry, integrating $K$ over a closed surface yields a topological invariant.

\end{figure}

The connection between $K$ and the geometrical frustration is explicitly stated through the coupling of $K$ to the free energy of an orientationally ordered phase confined to a surface.
Considering the topological charge density,
\begin{equation}
  \rho(\mathbf{r}) = 2 \pi \sum\limits_i s_{i}\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i}),\label{e:1-ChargeDens}
\end{equation}
due to disclinations indexed by $i$ possessing charge $s_{i}$ and position $\mathbf{r}_{i}$, where $\delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{r}_{i})$ is the Dirac delta, we can express Eq~\ref{e:2-XY} as~\cite{RN42,RN175,RN17}:
\begin{equation}
  F_d = -\frac{1}{2} k_f \int \textrm{d}^2\mathbf{r} \, \textrm{d}^2\mathbf{r}' \, G_L(\mathbf{r},\mathbf{r}') [\rho(\mathbf{r})-K(\mathbf{r})] [\rho(\mathbf{r}')-K(\mathbf{r}')],\label{e:1-TopTheoryofDefects}
\end{equation}
where $G_L$ is the Green's function of the Laplace-Beltrami operator, the standard Laplacian operator generalized to curved space~\cite{RN17}.
It is worth mentioning that Eq.~\ref{e:1-TopTheoryofDefects} is identical to the Coulomb energy of a plasma with both positively and negatively charged ion species having charge density $\rho$ in a background of charge density $-K$~\cite{RN17}.
Thus, we see that topological defects can be treated as charged particles that couple to the surface via a background charge provided by the Gaussian curvature of the surface.

To investigate the role of curvature on ordered materials, we need to consider a space with varying Gaussian curvature and ideally, a space including Gaussian curvature of different sign.
While there have been new discoveries as a result of examining defect structures on spheres~\cite{RN106,RN26,RN110,RN76,RN101,RN165}, including prior work with spherical nematic shells~\cite{RN45,RN105}, the Gaussian curvature and therefore the background topological charge density is constant in these cases.
As a result, the impact of curvature only enters through the sphere radius.
This is borne out in both the size-dependent onset of grain-boundary scars in colloidal crystals on the surface of emulsion drops~\cite{RN26,RN110}, and in the fact that the positions of the four $s = +1/2$ defects in nematic shells are entirely determined by the defect-defect interactions, with the underlying geometry playing no role~\cite{RN45}.

The simplest closed surface with regions of both $K>0$ and $K<0$ is the torus [Figure~\ref{f:1-ChiObjects}(C)], which has $g = 1$ and thus $\chi = 0$.
In addition, we see that not only does a torus have sphere-like positive Gaussian curvature on its outer region and saddle-like negative Gaussian curvature on its inner region, but according to Eq~\ref{e:1-GB2}, the integrated Gaussian curvature over an entire torus must vanish.
Similarly, by Eq.~\ref{e:1-PH}, an orientationally ordered material on the surface of a torus must have vanishing topological charge and thus can support a defect-free configuration.

Prior work in our group investigated nematic order inside a torus using toroidal droplets made from a NLC, with the nematic director constrained to lie parallel to the interface between the toroidal droplet and the outer continuous medium~\cite{RN24,RN47}.
The varying curvature of the torus yielded doubly-twisted ground state with no defects~\cite{RN24}, as drawn for both a left-handed twist and a right-handed twist in Figure~\ref{f:1-Torus}(A,B), respectively.
The double-twist is directly related to a director distortion called saddle-splay, which favors the director in the plane of the surface aligning along the smallest principal curvature~\cite{RN59}.
We found that the amount of twist in the ground state can be controlled by the aspect ratio, or slenderness of the torus $\xi = R_0/a$, with $R_0$ the radius of the central circle of the torus and $a$ the tube radius of the torus, as defined in the top view schematic in Figure~\ref{f:1-Torus}(C).
In addition, as seen by the possibility of having either a left-handed or a right-handed twist, this doubly-twisted state manifests itself through a spontaneous reflection symmetry breaking, where the form of the free energy resembles that of the Landau theory of magnetism.
This analogy is exact for a linear twist in the cylindrical limit, where $\xi \rightarrow \infty$~\cite{RN293}.
These results clearly illustrate how confinement within surfaces of non-constant $K$ can affect the ground state of a system, even in the absence of defects.

There are, however, 3D nematic fields with defects in their bulk.
For example, consider a nematic inside a volume with the director at the surface of the volume of the perpendicular to the surface.
We call this homeotropic anchoring.
If the volume is a sphere, we then see that irrespective of how we arrange the director in the bulk, there must be an irreducible singularity.
Bulk singularities that are points are known as hedgehogs and are characterized by their hedgehog charge,
\begin{equation}
  q = \frac{1}{4 \pi} \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \textrm{d}\theta \: \textrm{d}\phi \: \mathbf{n} \cdot \left [ \partial_{\theta} \mathbf{n} \times \partial_{\phi} \mathbf{n} \right ],\label{e:1-HedgehogCharge}
\end{equation}
where the integral is taken over a topologically spherical surface enclosing the defect, and $\theta$ and $\phi$ are, respectively, the polar and azimuthal angles on that surface~\cite{RN153}.
In this case, instead of counting the number of times the director wraps around $\mathbb{S}^1$, as we did for the topological charge, we consider the orientation of $\mathbf{n}$ on the spherical surface enclosing the defect mapped to $\mathbb{S}^2$, the unit sphere.
The integrand in Eq.~\ref{e:1-HedgehogCharge} is the Jacobian from the director on the topologically spherical surface in real space to $\mathbb{S}^2$; it tells us how much area on $\mathbb{S}^2$ is covered by $\mathbf{n}$ on the surface enclosing the defect.
Thus, the hedgehog charge is then the number of times the orientations of $\mathbf{n}$ cover $\mathbb{S}^2$~\cite{RN153}.
Therefore, confining a NLC to a volume that is topologically spherical with homeotropic boundary conditions must yield a total ``hedgehog charge'' $|q|=1$.

In this Thesis, we investigate the role of geometry in the interplay between order and confinement.
In Chapter 2, we begin with an introduction to the theory of nematic liquid crystals.
Then, in Chapter 3, we consider nematic order on the surface of a torus.
This is different from previous studies where the NLC filled the torus~\cite{RN24,RN274,RN44}.
Due to the difficulty of creating a thin, stable, toroidal shell of a NLC, we use a polymeric nematic that self-assembles at the interface between two immiscible liquids.
Importantly, with this system we can generate stable toroidal droplets as in our previous work, and investigate 2D nematic order on a toroidal surface.
In addition, the nematic is active, meaning that the individual constituent particles have their own source of internal energy.
The activity then drives the nematic out of equilibrium at the individual particle level, generally causing the generation of pairs of $s = \pm 1/2$ defects that are constantly in motion and constantly being created and annihilated.
Even though we have an inherently nonequilibrium material, we find that predictions built upon Eq.~\ref{e:1-TopTheoryofDefects} hold and that adding activity to order qualitatively resembles bringing an equilibrium system to the high temperature limit.
However, there are significant differences with equilibrium nematics, which we will highlight.

In Chapter 4, we consider a NLC confined to toroidal droplets with homeotropic anchoring.
With the director constrained to lie perpendicular to the surface, the saddle-splay distortion does not affect the free energy minimization.
However, we still find a twisted ground-state configuration, where the amount of twist depends on $\xi$, eventually disappearing as $\xi \rightarrow \infty$.
Experiments with NLC confined to straight and bent cylindrical capillaries under homeotropic boundary conditions reveal that the twist is a response to the additional curvature induced when deforming a cylinder of homeotropic nematic into a torus.
This is new; prior experiments in cylinders found a twisted ground state only when NLC that favor twist distortions were used.
In our case, the confining geometry induces twist even in NLC that do not preferentially favor twist distortions.

In Chapter 5, we return to a spherical topology, confining NLC to a capillary bridge with homeotropic anchoring to study the influence of confinement shape on defect type.
We generate waist-shaped and barrel-shaped bridges and find that waist-shaped bridges contain hyperbolic defects with negative hedgehog charge while barrel-shaped bridge contain radial defects with positive hedgehog charge.
In addition, we find that the ratio of the bridge height to its width determines whether or not the singularity is a ring defect or a hedgehog.

In Chapter 6, we summarize, conclude, and present results that open the door to future work that builds on this Thesis.
