@misc{crockerGrierNotes,
note = {The tracking minimizes $\sum_i \delta_i$, where $\delta_i$ is the
distance between the i$^{\rm th}$ particle in one image and a candidate particle in the
subsequent image. For $N$ particles, this scales like $\mathcal{O}(N!)$; to reduce runtime,
the algorithm has a cutoff length $L$, considering possible candidates only
where $\delta_i < L$.}

@misc{uncorrelatedNoise,
note = {At each timestep, a random acceleration, or kick, is added to the equations of motion;
each kick is drawn indepently from the same probability distribution.}
}

@misc{activeViscosity,
note = {The viscosity of the active nematic in the tubulent regime is primarily
determined by the surrounding medium. Since we keep the same outer medium, we use
the same viscosity for both ATP concentrations.}
}

@misc{gaussianApprox,
note = {The probability distribution for the number of particles in an
equilibrium system subject to number fluctuations can be approximated by a
Gaussian distribution when $N$ is large. In this limit, the fluctuations can
be determined from the width of the distribution.}
}

@misc{turbulentNematic,
note = {The turbulence in the flow is due to the vortices introduced by the
$s = +1/2$ defects [see Figure blah]. The large number of vortices span a range
of length scales, and the resulting flow field leads to chaotic mixing.}

note = {A material engineered to exhibit properties not found in nature.
For example, a material engineered to have a negative index of refraction is a
metamaterial.}

@misc{williamsCrit,
note = {The Williams criterion is found using a linear stability analysis on a
twisted-bipolar ansatz considering small twist angles.}
}

@misc{fret,
note = {FRET describes nonradiative energy transfer between an excited donor fluorphore
and an unexcited acceptor fluorphore. The donor and acceptor have different
spectra and thus the amount of transferred energy between the donor and the acceptor
can be measured via the relative emission of the donor and acceptor species.}
